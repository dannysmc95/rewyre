# Introduction

Firstly, welcome to the rewyre documentation, the docs folder contains a series of markdown files to document the structure of an application, in this guide we shall build the basic to-do demo in the `/test` directory and in each stage I shall explain what, how and why to the whole process. Before we can do that we need to discuss some basic naming conventions and processes on how it works.

Throughout this demo all examples will be done in TypeScript as it is the suggested language to use, but you can use JavaScript as the library is compiled to JavaScript with the TypeScript definitions.

## Controllers

A controller is a class that defines a series of methods, each method can be a route or can just be a function, we suggest using providers for external functionality to make sure the controller class is clean and concise as this will essentially be your actual code for each route, but as well your routing.

You can have many classes and each class can be prefixed, so you can prefix a class with `/api` and then create a new route method inside with the path: `/hello` which means you can access it from the browser using `http://localhost:3000/api/hello` - this depends on your hostname and port settings, but that is the default.

> **Routing Notes:** If you want to have no prefix for a certain controller, for example you're making a website, then you may want to use the `/<route>` path, instead of `/<prefix>/<route>` so you can set either the prefix or the route path to `/` which will nullify it, so example to create an about us page, available at: `/about-us` then you can set the controller's prefix to: `/` and the route path as `/about-us` and if you want to use the domain directly, you can also set the route path to `/` which means it will do: `//` which rewyre rewrites as: `/` meaning you can get to the domain, useful if you are using rewyre to serve HTML. Last point regarding this is if you have an account section which you want to me: `/account` and you want to make sure all code is together, you can set the controller prefix to: `/account` and then set the route path to `/` which turns into: `/account/` or `/account`.
